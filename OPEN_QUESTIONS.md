## The nightly needs GCP credentials in GitHub (2026-11-02)

`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` never ran: its YAML didn't parse (fixed in a1e079306). Now it parses, it needs the repository's `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` and `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` secrets and its `FXDAX_GCE_PROJECT` and `FXDAX_NIGHTLY_BUCKET` variables, none of which is set. Granting GitHub access to the GCP project is yours.
**Recommended:** a workload identity pool for `semistrict/fxdax` and a service account allowed to make and delete GCE instances and write the nightly bucket.
**Until then:** each nightly fails at its auth step; TASK-69's runs stay manual.

# Decisions

## 54 stale In Progress tasks triaged: 46 closed, 7 back to To Do (2026-11-02)

Decided with the user: criteria are ours, so a task whose work landed, or whose rest isn't worth doing as written, is closed, and its final summary says what was decided not to do. Unmet criteria stay unchecked. Back to To Do, as real work left that nobody is on: TASK-42.11, 79.82, 91.15, 111.1 (the pgbench decay over five runs, the one task carrying it), 149.2, 149.14, 150.6 (now depending on TASK-153.9); TASK-60 too, waiting on 60.1. Left alone: TASK-158, uncommitted work in worktree t3-9b5982f8. Also closed: TASK-153.6, done by fafefbac7 and 106b6128d, and TASK-153.10, 112.5 and 109.1, about evacuation, which fafefbac7 removed.
**Instead:** keep each open until its criteria are met as written.
**Undoing it:** `backlog task edit <id> -s "To Do"`; each task's notes and summary say what was left.

## Unmerged branches became `archive/` tags, not deleted outright (2026-11-02)

No long-lived branches now (AGENTS.md). Branches already in main went. Unmerged ones, untouched for two days and checked out nowhere, became tags `archive/<branch>`: 50 local, 5 on GitHub, where only main is left. Kept as they were: branches checked out in a worktree or changed in the last two days, as other sessions may be on them.
**Instead:** delete them outright, losing their commits once the reflog expires.
**Undoing it:** `git branch <name> archive/<name>`, then delete the tag.

## Truncate on a full disk: one path zeroes the tail (TASK-150.19)

Rarely, truncated bytes come back on a truly full filesystem. Decided: every non-DAX growth takes one path that zeroes the tail, with one owner of file size (TASK-153.4).
**Instead:** a mid-block shrink could return `NoSpace`, partly reversing TASK-60.
**Undoing it:** before TASK-153.4 lands, nothing; after, the single path stays and only the shrink's error changes.

## Corrupted file data: the host's checksums catch it (TASK-153.11)

A byte damaged in storage, by a bad disk or a bad upload, must make a read fail rather than return the wrong byte. Decided: rely on the host's CRC32C in `extent_frame`, confirm every host read path checks it, and close gaps there. The guest doesn't check.
- Fxfs's own data checksums are read only at journal replay, as in Fuchsia's code, and DAX stores skip Fxfs's write path so have none.
- Pages already in the DAX window are read straight from memory, so nothing can check them there.
- Still uncovered: data on a host's disk before it's sealed, and pages already in memory.

**Instead:** the guest checks too, costing reads on the fast path.
**Undoing it:** adding guest checks later doesn't conflict with anything this does.

## A fork of an extent mapped writably holds it as of the last commit (TASK-153.3)

Today such a fork gets `EBUSY` (TASK-150.7). Decided: the fork holds the extent as of the last commit, as the spec says, so the host half of TASK-153.3 goes ahead. This reaches only a VM process's own raw FORK: production forks use `fork_quiescent`.
**Instead:** the fork also holds the mapped, uncommitted bytes.
**Undoing it:** the fork path in TASK-153.3 copies the mapped bytes as well.

## A device write to an extent not known to be open is taken, not refused (TASK-153.3)

The task's direction had such a write retry rather than reopen its extent. Decided: the store takes it, and nothing records the extent open, ever again: the open extents are those minted since the last seal (`OpenExtents`). Plain writers (multi_write, the journal, layer files) have no retry, where `SealedExtent` is EIO, and DAX's is dax.c's `gate != seals` already.
**Instead:** refuse it in the guest's device, and give every writer a retry.
**Undoing it:** a check in `write_with_opts`, and retries at each writer: `dead-ends/refusing-writes-to-extents-not-known-open.md` has why not.

## Shared blocks of an open extent never go through its region (TASK-153.3)

A clone's blocks in an open extent read `Shared`, and get a range of their own, read-only, never a slice of the extent's region: so a region of an open extent is never mapped read-only. Costs a MAP of their own for reflinked small files' blocks until their extent seals.
**Instead:** keep the checks in `region_open`, `map_to` and `new_slice` that let a reader and a writer share a region (TASK-99, 140, 44.21, 150.11).
**Undoing it:** `fxfs_dax_new_slice`'s one line, and those checks back.

## NoOpenUnderLock.cfg asks what it can now (TASK-153.3)

Its rule, region_open under the region's lock, went with the look it guarded: a reader and a writer don't share a region. The file is back, taking away the rules that keep them apart, and `MapUnderAnOpen.cfg` asks for the race itself, a reader's MAP in flight as a writer opens the region.
**Instead:** put the region's lock back in `region_open`, dead, for the rule to mean what it did.
**Undoing it:** the lock back in dax.c and the rule in the spec.

## 106b6128d's lag under a PTE is fixed on refactor/open-once (TASK-153.3)

A write through a region left a fault's PTE of the page it lags, read stale: found here, verifying the merge, so fixed here, its own commit, with a mutant.
**Instead:** a task of its own on main.
**Undoing it:** revert 157417ad5.
