## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
read_line has no length limit and the timeout applies to each read(), so any client that can reach the port grows a String until the daemon is OOM-killed and every VM stops. A slow client blocks all scrapes forever.

Where: crates/fxdax/src/extentd/metrics.rs:245, crates/fxdax/src/extentd/metrics.rs:234, crates/fxdax/src/bin/fxdax-extentd.rs:103.

Found by the 2026-10-21 review of main at 6a0a3f8 (severity medium): docs/reviews/2026-10-21-main.md, 'Correctness issues', has its evidence and a suggested fix. Related: TASK-47. Not tracked. TASK-47 (Done) wrote the minimal HTTP/1.1 metrics responder that has the unbounded read_line and serves one connection at a time.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A test reproduces the failure on the code before the fix
- [ ] #2 Fixed, and the test passes on macOS and on Linux (GCE)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 cargo nextest run --workspace passes on macOS and Linux (Lima)
- [ ] #2 scripts/upstream-changes.py --check passes
- [ ] #3 Deviations from upstream documented where they occur
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Handed over (2026-10-24): fixed on branch review/r2b-extentd (48 commits on main b5eb2fc8, rebased onto 709a7017), not on main. Verified on Linux (GCE): workspace 2614/2614 and every Shuttle suite; guest fxfs-guest, -dax, -checks, extent-guest, -follow, -live-fork, -daemon-lost, -snapshot, -snapshot-dax, -pgbench, -pgbench-dax OK. fxfs-guest-checks-dax failed on TASK-79.104's guest crash (fixed since on main), and fxfs-guest-follow-torture failed 1 of 3 on main alone and 1 of 3 with these commits (TASK-79.58's flake). Blocked only on a push: the branch's vendor/firecracker points at 6610d88f1, three commits on semistrict/firecracker fxdax-v1.16.1 past 1fbc852f9 (535defc6e TASK-79.41, 8ea641a6d and 6610d88f1 TASK-92.13), in /Users/ramon/src/fxdax/.claude/worktrees/r2bm/vendor/firecracker; push those first, then the branch to main, rebasing onto main (guest-only changes since).

On main (2026-10-24): round 2b rebased onto main and pushed with the guest batch, 08790a954..b158ce82b; Firecracker 535defc6e..6610d88f1 on fxdax-v1.16.1. Green on macOS (scripts/test.sh, 2508) and Linux (GCE r65: workspace 2620, Firecracker extent tests, 17 guest cases). The criterion of a test failing before the fix isn't recorded here: check the round 2b commit that names this task before ticking it.
